WIP

Plan of action:
I plan on spreading the timeline out across the full 15 weeks of the semester, most likely into three
sections. The first and longest section will be doing analysis of the high and low density areas and
calculating a variety of factors. I will then go in and manually collect the data and verify whether the
initial theories and expectations were correct. Once I do that I will conduct an analysis on the data,
and run simulation models to predict whether my proposed changes would help, reduce bandwith
congestion. Finally I will organize all my data and results and draw a conclusion from them and
make the poster. I would like everything other than the poster to be done by december 1st of the fall
semester, so to leave myself ample time for creating a poster and wrapping up all other work.

So to summarize:
weeks 1-2: Acquiring any hardware or software that is necessary as well as initial hypothesis
weeks 3-8: Gathering data, and completing projections
weeks 7-10: Analysis of data
weeks 9-12: Drawing conclusions, implementing improved model
weeks 13-15: Concluding project, making poster

General Hypothesis: Speeds slow down to high congestion. Download is vulnerable to the wims of an upload test.


Testing methodologies:
Methods that might need to be done to put strain on a network and possibly isolate issues...
* Downloading a large file from a known high speed server on one device and run a ping and speedtest in parallel on another device measuring changes from one to another. Similarly test this theory with an upload test.
